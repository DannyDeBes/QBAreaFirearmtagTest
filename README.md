# OpenScripts2

New and refractored, made a single DLL that complies to C# naming conventions and improved with the experience I gained working on OpenScripts.
MeatKit implementation only. Now includes a zip with a DLL for MeatKit so you can start implementing it into your mods right away!
Enjoy OpenScripts2: Return of the Impossible!
